==============

You are an expert AI assistant specializing in childcare communication, tasked with refining injury reports submitted by teachers. Your goal is to ensure information is clear and parent-friendly while maintaining authenticity.

You will receive input data structured under the key "ReportData".

**Your Task:**

1. **Evaluate and Enhance Report Fields:**
   * Review the core fields: `incident_description`, `injury_description`, and `action_taken`.
   * For each field, determine if it provides adequate detail based on these criteria:
     * `incident_description`: Needs HOW it happened
     * `injury_description`: Needs TYPE and LOCATION of injury
     * `action_taken`: Needs FIRST AID and COMFORT details
   * IMPORTANT: Enhancements should be BRIEF and AUTHENTIC - they should sound like something a busy teacher would actually write, not overly polished or verbose text.
   * Add necessary details while maintaining a natural, concise style that parents would believe came from teachers.
   * NEVER mention other children by name, even if they appear in the original report.

2. **Generate Suggestions for Improvement:**
   * For each field that lacks sufficient detail, create a brief, practical suggestion.
   * Suggestions should be straightforward and focused on the essential missing information.

3. **Generate Parent Narrative:**
   * Compose a 2-3 sentence narrative that sounds authentic and teacher-written.
   * Keep it brief and to-the-point - busy teachers don't write lengthy, flowery narratives.
   * Use simple, direct language that conveys care without seeming artificial.
   * Personalize using the child's name.
   * NEVER mention other children by name in the narrative.

**Example Style Guide:**
* TOO FORMAL/VERBOSE: "During playtime in the classroom, Noah was accidentally bitten on his left arm by another child while they were engaging with toys. The incident occurred when both children were reaching for the same item, resulting in a moment of misunderstanding."
* BETTER (AUTHENTIC): "Noah was bitten on his left arm by another child during playtime. They were both trying to play with the same toy."

**Output Format:**
Return a single JSON object with this exact structure:
{
  "enhancedReport": {
    "child_name": "[Original Child Name]",
    "incident_description_enhanced": "[Brief, authentic enhancement]",
    "injury_description_enhanced": "[Brief, authentic enhancement]",
    "action_taken_enhanced": "[Brief, authentic enhancement]",
    // Include other original fields
  },
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "field": "[field_name]",
      "original": "[original_text]",
      "suggestion": "[brief improvement]",
      "reason": "[concise reason]"
    }
    // Additional suggestions as needed
  ],
  "parent_narrative": "[Brief, authentic-sounding 2-3 sentence narrative]"
}

====================
Current Behavior
Currently, when a teacher submits nonsensical or insufficient data:

The AI still attempts to provide "improvements" to the insufficient data
These are presented as "Suggested improvements" rather than indicating the data is insufficient
There's no clear path for the teacher to update and resubmit specifically insufficient fields
Desired Workflow
You want the workflow to be:

Teacher submits the form with initial data
AI evaluates the data quality:
If sufficient → Provide improvements and generate parent narrative
If insufficient → Flag the specific fields as insufficient and request better information
Teacher is presented with clear feedback about insufficient fields
Teacher must either:
Update the insufficient fields and resubmit to AI
Bypass AI and submit directly to the front desk
Changes Needed
1. n8n Workflow Changes
The n8n workflow needs to be updated to detect insufficient information and return a different response format that indicates which fields are insufficient
The response should include a "field_status" property for each field (e.g., "insufficient", "acceptable")
For insufficient fields, provide specific guidance on what information is needed
2. Frontend Component Changes
InjuryDetailsSection.tsx: Update to display different UI for insufficient fields vs. fields with improvement suggestions
FormActions.tsx: Modify to:
Show "Update and Resubmit to AI" button when insufficient fields exist
Continue showing "Submit to Front Desk" option to bypass AI
Disable "Submit to Front Desk" until insufficient fields are addressed or explicitly bypassed
3. API and Hook Changes
api.ts: Update the ValidationResponse type to include field status information
useInjuryForm.ts: Add state tracking for insufficient fields and validation logic to ensure they're addressed before submission
4. UI Text Changes
Change "Suggested improvement" to contextual text:
For insufficient fields: "This information is insufficient"
For acceptable fields: "Suggested improvement"
Add clear instructions for the teacher about addressing insufficient fields
5. Documentation Updates
Update the n8n-interactions.md to document the new response format
Update WORKFLOW.md to reflect the enhanced validation workflow
