# Simplified Test Plan: Teacher Form Test Data Integration

## Phase 1: Setup and Test Data Creation (COMPLETED)
**Checkpoint: User consultation and approval required before proceeding**

1. **Create Simple Folder Structure** (COMPLETED)
   - Created new subfolder: `tests/test-scenarios/`
   - Added README.md explaining purpose and usage
   - Added TEST_PLAN.md for reference

2. **Create Test Scenarios with User Input** (COMPLETED)
   - Created four JSON test files with realistic teacher entries:
     - `adequate-descriptions.json` - Detailed entries from a busy but thorough teacher
     - `inadequate-descriptions.json` - Very brief entries needing improvement
     - `mixed-quality-descriptions.json` - Some good details, some minimal information
     - `minimal-payload-test.json` - Minimal test with "1" for all fields to test payload format

3. **Server Management Documentation** (COMPLETED)
   - Added server management instructions to README.md

**Checkpoint: User review and approval of test data before proceeding** (COMPLETED)

## Phase 2: Test Component Implementation
**Checkpoint: User consultation and approval required before proceeding**

1. **Create Minimal Test Component**
   - Implement a simple, focused component that only does what's needed
   - Add it to TeacherForm.tsx with a single conditional render line
   - Include clear TEST-ONLY markers in comments for easy removal
   - Keep the component under 200 lines of code
   - Add visual distinction (dashed border, "TEST MODE ONLY" label)

2. **Implement Dynamic Test Script Loading**
   - Create a simple function to read test scenarios from the directory
   - Populate dropdown without hardcoding scenario names
   - Focus on readability over performance

3. **Form Population Logic**
   - Use the simplest effective approach to populate form fields
   - Ensure it works with the existing form without modifying core logic
   - Add clear comments explaining how it works and how to remove it

**Checkpoint: User review and approval of component before proceeding**

## Phase 3: Testing and Verification
**Checkpoint: User consultation and approval required before proceeding**

1. **Server Management**
   - Document how to kill all existing test servers
   - Provide clear steps to start a new server for testing
   - Verify the server is running correctly before proceeding

2. **Functionality Testing**
   - Test each scenario to ensure it works as expected
   - Verify form submission and n8n response handling
   - Document any issues or unexpected behavior

3. **Cleanup Verification**
   - Test removing the test components
   - Verify the application works normally after removal
   - Ensure no test code remains in production files

**Checkpoint: User review and approval of testing results**

## Implementation Notes

1. **Simplicity First**
   - Keep all solutions as simple as possible
   - Avoid introducing new patterns or technologies
   - Focus on readability over performance

2. **Clean Code Organization**
   - Keep all files under 200-300 lines
   - Use clear, consistent naming conventions
   - Add concise, helpful comments

3. **Environment Awareness**
   - Ensure test components only run in development/test environments
   - Never affect production environment
   - Use environment variables to control test features

4. **Removal Documentation**
   - All test files will include a simple header:
   ```javascript
   /**
    * TEST COMPONENT - REMOVE FOR PRODUCTION
    * 
    * Purpose: [Brief description]
    * Removal: Delete this file and remove the import from [file]
    */
   ```
   - All test code in existing files will be marked:
   ```javascript
   // TEST-ONLY - REMOVE FOR PRODUCTION
   // [code]
   // END TEST-ONLY
   ```

5. **Server Management**
   - Always kill existing servers before starting new ones
   - Verify server status after starting
   - Document server commands for quick reference
